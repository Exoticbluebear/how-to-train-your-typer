## Features
- **Difficulty Levels**: Users can select from Easy, Medium, or Hard paragraphs. This allows for a tailored experience, where beginners can start with simpler texts and progressively challenge themselves with more complex material. This structured approach encourages gradual improvement and confidence building.

- **Dynamic Typing Feedback**: The application provides real-time feedback on accuracy and typing speed, helping users understand their performance immediately.

- **Typing Metrics**: Displays crucial metrics such as:
  - **Mistakes**: Keeps track of errors made during typing, which helps users identify areas for improvement.
  - **Words Per Minute (WPM)**: Measures typing speed based on correct words typed in a minute.
  - **Characters Per Minute (CPM)**: Shows the number of correctly typed characters per minute.

- **Progress Tracking**: Users can monitor their improvement over time, motivating them to practice regularly and set personal goals.

- **Print Report Feature**: After completing a typing exercise, users can generate a detailed report of their performance. This report can be used for typing test exams, providing a comprehensive overview of their skills. It includes:
  - The text they attempted to type, highlighting both correct and incorrect portions.
  - Metrics such as total mistakes, WPM, and CPM.
  - Instructions on how to interpret the results, making it suitable for both self-assessment and formal evaluations.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app features a clean, responsive design that enhances the overall user experience, making typing practice enjoyable and accessible.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling and ensuring a responsive design.
- **React Hooks**: For state management and side effects.
- **JavaScript**: For core functionality.

## Usage
1. **Select a Difficulty Level**: Choose between Easy, Medium, or Hard to load a corresponding paragraph. This choice allows users to tailor their practice based on their current skill level and goals.

2. **Start Typing**: Begin typing in the input field. The application tracks your progress, providing immediate feedback on your performance.

3. **Generate a Report**: After completing the exercise, use the "Print Report" button to create a detailed report of your typing performance. This report is useful for:
   - **Typing Test Exams**: Use it to assess your typing proficiency in formal settings.
   - **Self-Improvement**: Review your mistakes and typing speed to identify areas for growth.

4. **Progress Tracking**: Return regularly to challenge yourself with different difficulty levels, track your improvements, and set new goals for your typing speed and accuracy.

## How It Works
- The application utilizes React components to manage the user interface, state, and interactions.
- It maintains a selection of paragraphs categorized by difficulty level, randomly choosing one for the user to type.
- Real-time feedback tracks correct and incorrect keystrokes, updating WPM and CPM metrics to provide a clear picture of performance.
- A timer adds an element of challenge, encouraging users to complete the exercise within a set time.
